To use this code you can either install it manually on a local XAMPP/WAMP server, on a remote server with php and mysql or in a Docker Container:
Here are the steps to install it on XAMPP local server:
- Clone this repo in htdocs folder of your XAMPP installation: ```git clone https://github.com/vivianvanatu/products-restapi.git```
- Create a database with the user and password from config.php (you can change the details if you like, just make sure that data from config.php matches the new database)
- Import products.sql into the newly created database
